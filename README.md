# Codecophony: compose music through programming

A library for composing music by writing Rust code. Currently in very early development.

I was a Rust beginner when I started this project, so some of my code may not be elegant or idiomatic.

I write this code using speech-to-text software that isn't designed for programming, so some parts of the code may be formatted horribly. It is NOT useful to point out formatting problems, except to remind me to run `cargo fmt` occasionally.
