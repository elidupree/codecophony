# Codecophony: compose music through programming

(This code is obsolete.  All related code is currently in https://github.com/elidupree/eliduprees-website-source `codecophony.py` and the JavaScript files it includes.  One of those, `media/[editable_stuff/]voice-practice-tool-lib.js`, is shared with voice-practice-tool.)

A library for composing music by writing Rust code. Currently in very early development.

I'm a Rust beginner, so some of my code may not be elegant or idiomatic. I'd appreciate people pointing out what I'm doing wrong.

I write this code using speech-to-text software that isn't designed for programming, so some parts of the code may be formatted horribly. It is NOT useful to point out formatting problems, except to remind me to run `cargo fmt` occasionally.

## Examples

`first.rs` writes a little ditty to a file.
